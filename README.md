### Quick
For a quick installation, run the following command to download the plugin directly:
```bash

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
### Keybinding

Add the following configuration to your [Zellij config](https://zellij.dev/documentation/configuration.html) inside the [keybinds](https://zellij.dev/documentation/keybindings.html) section:

```kdl
shared_except "locked" {
    bind "Alt B" {
        LaunchOrFocusPlugin "file:~/.config/zellij/plugins/zellij-bookmarks.wasm" {
            floating true
            cwd "/home/<USER>/.config/zellij/"
        };
    }
}
```
> **Note**: You likely already have a `shared_except "locked"` section in your configuration. Add the `bind` command there.

> **Note**: Make sure to replace \<USER\> in the cwd path with your actual username.

> **Important**: The cwd parameter is required. For details on why and what to do if it disappears after a Zellij update, see the [FAQ.md](FAQ.md).

#### Parameters

- **`cwd`**: *(REQUIRED)* - The *ABSOLUTE PATH* where your bookmarks file will be stored.
- **`exec`**: *(default: `false`)* - If `true`, the command will execute immediately after pressing `Enter`. This can be overridden per bookmark.
- **`ignore_case`**: *(default: `true`)* - When filtering, ignores case sensitivity in both the filter string and bookmark/label names.
- **`autodetect_filter_mode`**: *(default: `true`)* - Automatically determines the filtering mode (ID or Name) based on the entered filter string, eliminating the need for manual mode switching.
- **`filename`**: *(default: `.zellij_bookmarks.yaml`)* - The name of the bookmarks file.
- **`bind_edit`**: *(default: `Ctrl e`)* Keybinding to open the bookmark configuration file in an editor.
- **`bind_reload`**: *(default: `Ctrl r`)* Keybinding to reload bookmarks.
- **`bind_switch_filter_label`**: *(default: `Ctrl l`)* Keybinding to switch to label filtering mode.
- **`bind_switch_filter_id`**: *(default: `Ctrl i`)* Keybinding to switch to id filtering mode.
- **`bind_describe`**: *(default: `Ctrl d`)* Keybinding to display the description of the selected bookmark.

### Bookmarks Configuration

The bookmarks configuration is a YAML file that defines your bookmarks. Here's a detailed explanation of the configuration structure and its usage.

### Configuration Structure

#### 1. **`vars`**
A global key-value map for variables. These variables can be used to parameterize commands and bookmarks.

- Use the templating syntax `{{ <variable_name> }}` to reference a variable.
- If you need to include `{{ ... }}` as a literal string in your commands (e.g., for tools like `crictl`), you must escape it with double backslashes (`\\`).

  **Example:**
  ```yaml
  cmds:
  - crictl inspect --output go-template --template '\\{{.info.pid}}' $CTR
  ```

#### 2. **`cmds`**
A map for frequently used commands that aren't directly insertable into the terminal. 
You can include them in bookmarks by referencing them as `cmd::<command_key>`.

#### 3. **`bookmarks`**
A list of bookmarks. Each bookmark has the following fields:

- **`name`**: A unique name for the bookmark. Can be used to link to a bookmark in other bookmarks.
- **`cmds`**: A list of commands for the bookmark. These can include:
   - Plain text commands.
   - Commands referenced from `cmds` using `cmd::<command_key>`.
   - Commands imported from other bookmarks using `bookmark::<bookmark_name>`.
- **`desc`**: *(optional)* A description of the bookmark to provide context or explanation about its purpose.
- **`exec`**: *(optional)* A boolean flag indicating whether the commands should be executed immediately.
- **`labels`**: *(optional)* A list of labels or tags associated with the bookmark.
- **`vars`**: *(optional)* Local variables specific to the bookmark. These have a higher priority than global `vars`.

Commands within a bookmark are concatenated using the separator `&&`.

### Key Concepts

- **Templating with Variables**:  
  Variables defined in `vars` or bookmark-specific `vars` can be used in commands or bookmarks using the syntax `{{ <variable_name> }}`. Bookmark-specific variables take precedence over global ones, allowing flexible and context-specific command customization.

- **Command Reuse with `cmds`**:
   - Use `cmd::<command_key>` to reference predefined reusable commands from `cmds`.
   - Use `bookmark::<bookmark_name>` to include all commands from another bookmark into the current one.
   - Commands are concatenated with `&&`, ensuring sequential execution.

This structure provides a modular, reusable, and powerful way to parameterize commands and configurations using simple templating and bookmark composition.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
vars:
  global_var: "Global value"
  path: "/home/user"

cmds:
  greet: "echo 'Hello, World!'"
  list_files: "ls -la {{ path }}"
  custom_echo: "echo '{{ message }}'"

bookmarks:
- name: "Bookmark1"
  desc: "A test bookmark combining plain text and reusable commands."
  cmds:
  - "echo 'This is Bookmark1'"
  - cmd::greet
  - bookmark::Bookmark2
  - cmd::custom_echo
  exec: false
  labels:
  - "utilities"
  - "example"
  vars:
    message: "Bye Bye!"

- name: "Bookmark2"
  desc: "Command to list files dynamically using the path variable."
  cmds:
  - "cmd::list_files"
  exec: true
  labels:
  - "files"
 ```

### Explanation of the Example

#### **Global Variables**

- **`global_var`** and **`path`** are global variables accessible in all commands and bookmarks.
- The `{{ path }}` variable is used in `cmds` to dynamically include the value of `path`.

#### **Commands (`cmds`)**

- **`greet`**: A reusable command to print a greeting.
- **`list_files`**: A command to list files using the `path` variable.
- **`custom_echo`**: A customizable echo command using the `message` variable.

#### **Bookmarks**

##### **`Bookmark1`**
- Contains:
   - Plain text commands.
   - A reference to the reusable command `cmd::greet`.
   - Imports all commands from **Bookmark2** using `bookmark::Bookmark2`.
- Includes local variables that can customize command behavior.
- Result command that would paste to terminal: 
   ```bash
   echo 'This is Bookmark1' \
   && echo 'Hello, World!' \
   && ls -la /home/user \
   && echo 'Bye Bye!' 
   ```

##### **`Bookmark2`**
- Contains:
   - A command that uses the `list_files` command template (`cmd::list_files`).
- Is executed immediately because `exec: true` is set.
- Result command that would execute:
   ```bash
   ls -la /home/user
   ```
